# wikipedia_search
This is a browser extension that searches wikipedia for you. in firefox when you click on links it doesn't close the extension so you can open all 10 hits that your search pulls up.  
here's a screenshot of the extension: https://github.com/dmoneyballer/wikipedia_search/blob/master/extension/images/wikipedia%20extension.PNG
This is the url where you can add it to Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wikipedia-search/ddegbicimeoieleldgejoeoekoeabjpe 
I hope to have it published soon for firefox.
